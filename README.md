# Basics of Java
Welcome to the Basics of Java section! This section covers fundamental concepts and syntax of the Java programming language.

# Introduction to Java
Java is a widely-used, platform-independent programming language known for its simplicity and versatility. It was designed with the following key principles:

Object-Oriented: Everything in Java is an object, which allows for modular and reusable code.
Platform-Independent: Java programs can run on any device that has a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.
Secure: Java is designed to be secure, with features like bytecode verification.
Getting Started
Setting Up Your Environment
To start programming in Java, follow these steps to set up your environment:

# Download and Install Java Development Kit (JDK):

Visit the Oracle JDK download page or use OpenJDK.
Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
Set Up Your Development Environment:

Choose a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.
Your First Java Program
Let's write a simple "Hello, World!" program in Java to get started:
```
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
Explanation:
public class HelloWorld { ... }: Defines a class named HelloWorld.
public static void main(String[] args) { ... }: The entry point of any Java program. It's where the program starts executing.
System.out.println("Hello, World!");: Prints the string "Hello, World!" to the console.
Core Concepts
Variables and Data Types
In Java, variables are containers for storing data values. Java has several built-in data types, such as int, double, boolean, etc., to store different types of data.
```
int age = 30;
double price = 19.99;
boolean isJavaFun = true;
```

Control Flow
Java supports various control flow statements like if-else, switch-case, and loops (for, while, do-while) to control the flow of execution in a program.

```
int marks = 85;
if (marks >= 60) {
    System.out.println("Pass");
} else {
    System.out.println("Fail");
}
```
# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Java is an object-oriented programming language. It emphasizes concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

```
// Example of a class
class Car {
    String color;
    int maxSpeed;
    
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Color: " + color + ", Max Speed: " + maxSpeed);
    }
}
```
Exception Handling
Java provides robust exception handling mechanisms using try, catch, finally, and throw keywords to manage errors and exceptions in programs.
```
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
    int result = 10 / 0;
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    // Handle the exception
    System.out.println("Error: Division by zero");
}
```
